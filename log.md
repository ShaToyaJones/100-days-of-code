# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today is my first day of participating in 100 days of code! I began working on FreeCodeCamp because I want to review and improve my skills. 

**Thoughts:** My memory is serving me well! I have not forgotten as much as I thought I had.
